# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

Scope __limit access__ to certain variables to specific areas in development

Scope (-> access)  has two benefits:
* Security
* Naming

Types of Scope:
* global scope
* local scope
* function scope

Closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its surrounding state
-> closure __gives you access__ to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function
