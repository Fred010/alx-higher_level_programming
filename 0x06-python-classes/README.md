# Python - Classes and Objects

Classes are essentially a template to create your objects
* encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
* everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods
* object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions)
* a class is a blueprint for that object.
