# Python - if/else, loops, functions

_if...else statement_ is used to execute a block of code among two alternatives

The usual logic conditions used here:
* Equals: a == b
* Not Equals: a != b
* Less than: a < b
* Less than or equal to: a <= b
* Greater than: a > b
* Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways in if...else loops
